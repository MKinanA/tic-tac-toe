# Tic Tac Toe
This is a simple tic tac toe game made using HTML, CSS, and JS, the three components of front-end. You can access the page in [MKinanA.github.io/tic-tac-toe](https://mkinana.github.io/tic-tac-toe/).

## How to use it?
I believe you already know what is tic tac toe and how to play it. There is also a restart button to start the game over when the game is over, or to just restart in the middle of the game if you messed up.
